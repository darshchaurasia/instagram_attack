# Secure Login Interface Exploration

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a login page that mimics the design of a popular social media platform. It was developed to help me understand the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and PHP, particularly focusing on user interface design and secure form handling.

## Educational Purpose
- **Learn HTML and CSS**: Gain a deeper understanding of how to use HTML and CSS to create web interfaces.
- **Explore PHP for Backend Development**: Utilize PHP to manage form data securely.
- **Understand Authentication Processes**: Investigate how login systems work and how to implement them securely to protect user data.

## Ethical Considerations
This project was strictly for educational purposes. It was developed and tested in a controlled environment:
- No real user data was collected, stored, or used at any point.
- The project does not connect to the internet or any external networks.
- It serves as a tool to educate about potential vulnerabilities in web applications and the importance of implementing secure authentication systems.

## Features
- **Front-End Replica**: A front-end, visually similar to a popular social media login page.
- **Form Handling**: Implementation of form handling using PHP to understand server-side scripting.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have a local server environment like XAMPP or MAMP installed.
3. Place the project folder in your 'htdocs' or 'www' directory.
4. Start your server and navigate to the project directory in your web browser.

## Security Disclaimer
This project does not involve any real data and should not be used in any real-world applications. It is a demonstration of front-end replication and back-end integration for educational purposes only.
